<h1><?=$page_title;?>.</h1>

<p>My name is Kyle.<br />
I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia" target="_blank">British Columbia, Canada</a>, and still live here.</p>

<p>I am a web developer by profession / game developer by indie means / amateur woodworker and carpenter.</p>

<p>You might be asking yourself, why does this site look so basic? And the answer is this: I am not a web designer. There's a big difference there. And I'll be very forthcoming: I've spent years looking for a "look" that suits my personal site.<br />
Turns out.. you can't beat a classic.</p>
