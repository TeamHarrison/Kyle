<h2>Backstory.</h2>
<p>Long story short, I wanted to try out libGDX for my own amusement. I was watching a CodeBullet video where Mr. Bullet was making a bunch of really weird flappy bird clones using unorthodox display methods (such as using Windows Explorer as the renderer). I wondered how long it might take me to make a half way decent Flappy Bird clone myself, and I'd been dying to trying LibGDX for <em>something</em></p>
